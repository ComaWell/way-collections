WARNING: This library is in a very early prototyping stage- it is incomplete, undocumented, untested, certain to change dramatically, and currently lacks implementations for most common collection types.

This library exists to ideally define and re-implement common data structures using more concise, compartmentalized interfaces than provided by the Java Collections Framework.

This library currently lacks any further documentation, however I am happy to answer any questions regarding it via email at connor.matthew.wellington@gmail.com
